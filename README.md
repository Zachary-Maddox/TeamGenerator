## Description

Hello! The following application is a employee building template. First question is "would you like to add a emplyee(Yes/No)?" If yes the follow up question is "what employee (Intern, Manager, or Engineer)". Followed by a series of prompted question that allows you to build as many Interns , Managers, or Engineers as you need until you answer the question "would you like to add a employee" with no. Once your team is built it will display your team with their own unique card and information. See below for more info
